# Application of NLP to determine the state of issues in Bug Tracking Systems

The research work is about coming up with an automated process to determine the state of issue in Bug Tracking Systems i.e whether it is critical or not. In order to achive the goal we have utilized different state-of-the-art NLP techniques and Machine Learning algorithms alongwith deploying a Class Expansion phase for automated labelling of the tickets.

## Requirements
Other than the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt, code for Semi-Supervised Learners from following resources is utilized.<br>
